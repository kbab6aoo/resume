### DevOps Engineer / Cloud Engineer / Microsoft Windows Systems Administrator
A results-orientated DevOps Engineer with several years of experience in the delivery of scalable "cloud" enterprise projects and high performance solutions that are focussed around "SaaS", "PaaS", and "IaaS", I am customer focused with a proven track record in meeting Service Level Agreements (SLA's) and Key Performance Indicators (KPI's)

I am passionate about technology and Cloud Services. I enjoy a hands-on approach to technology. My background has allowed me to build a strong technical skill-set allowing me to devise creative solutions for various clients. I have a proven ability to deliver to demanding time scales, as well as working closely with clients to realize their aspirations.

I have spent the last 20 years working in IT with the last 5 years focussing on technologies I feel very passionate about including Cloud and Agile Delivery. Along the way, I have gained experience in many other areas, including virtualization and Open Source, networking and scalable architectures.
